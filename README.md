# Felipe Barros Professional WebSite

## Project Information

This website was developed with the intent of showing those interested in learning about my career.

<!-- Here, I describe the companies that trusted in my KnowHow to develop their Apps/Sites/Crawlers/Web Systems. I detail many of the systems I have developed, both in collaboration with work partners and on my own in freelancing gigs that have earned me recognition throughout my career as a Dev. 

> #### If I have been through your company or developed something for you, I deeply thank you for trusting in me, you have helped me grow professionally.
> &nbsp; -->

If I have helped you in any way, I ask that you send me a testimonial so that I can display it on this site.
